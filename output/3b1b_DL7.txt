# Lecture Notes on Understanding Multi-Layer Perceptrons in Large Language Models

## Introduction
- This lecture explores how large language models (LLMs) store knowledge, particularly focusing on the role of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in this process. 
- The goal is to demystify the computations within MLPs and illustrate how they can encode specific facts, using the example of Michael Jordan and basketball.

## Understanding Large Language Models
### The Basics of Language Models
- Language models are trained to predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding context.
- They operate on text that is tokenized into smaller units (tokens), each represented by high-dimensional vectors.

### The Role of Multi-Layer Perceptrons
- MLPs are crucial components of the architecture of transformers, which are the backbone of modern AI models.
- They perform computations that involve matrix multiplications and non-linear transformations, which are essential for encoding complex relationships in data.

### High-Dimensional Space
- Vectors in LLMs exist in high-dimensional spaces where different directions can represent various meanings or features.
- For example, the relationship between the embeddings of "woman" and "man" illustrates how gender information can be encoded in this space.

### Key Concept: Information Encoding
- Each vector must encode more than just the meaning of a single word; it needs to incorporate contextual information and general knowledge learned during training.
- MLPs provide the capacity to store facts, such as the relationship between Michael Jordan and basketball.

## The Mechanics of Multi-Layer Perceptrons
### Step-by-Step Computation
- The input vector representing a token (e.g., "Michael Jordan") undergoes a series of operations within the MLP.
- Each vector is processed independently, allowing for parallel computations.

### Matrix Multiplication
- The first operation involves multiplying the input vector by a large matrix filled with learned parameters (weights).
- This matrix can be thought of as containing various "questions" that probe different features of the input vector.

### Non-Linear Activation: ReLU
- After the linear transformation, a non-linear activation function, typically the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), is applied.
- ReLU outputs zero for negative values and retains positive values, effectively mimicking the behavior of an AND gate.

### Down Projection and Final Output
- The output from the ReLU is then multiplied by another matrix (down projection) and combined with a bias term.
- The final output vector is the sum of the transformed vector and the original input vector, allowing the model to encode additional information.

### Example: Encoding "Michael Jordan Plays Basketball"
- The MLP is set up to recognize the specific fact that "Michael Jordan plays basketball" by associating specific directions in the high-dimensional space with each component of the fact.
- The computations ensure that if the input vector encodes both "Michael" and "Jordan," the output will include the direction representing "basketball."

## Additional Analysis
- The operations within MLPs are foundational to how LLMs function, but the interpretation of individual neurons is complex.
- The concept of superposition suggests that neurons may not represent single features but rather combinations of features, complicating the interpretability of these models.
- Understanding the high-dimensional nature of the embeddings helps explain why LLMs can scale effectively, as they can represent more features than there are dimensions in the space.

## Conclusion
- The lecture provided a detailed examination of how MLPs in large language models process information and store facts.
- Key takeaways include the significance of high-dimensional spaces, the role of matrix multiplications, and the importance of non-linear transformations in encoding knowledge.

### General Tips
- To better understand LLMs, focus on the interplay between linear and non-linear operations within MLPs.
- Consider exploring the implications of high-dimensional spaces in machine learning and how they can influence model performance and interpretability.
- Engage with practical examples and visualizations to solidify your understanding of these complex concepts.
